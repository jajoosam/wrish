Wrish ✏️
===================
## A quick autosaving notepad

As soon as you open wrish, it will generate a hash and store your content. You can visit the url with the same hash, or share it, and can return to editing from where you left off!

Wrish also has a read only mode, which you can activate by pressing the `👀` button while editing.

Utilizing a service worker, Wrish can be added to the homescreen in android phones to make it feel native too!
